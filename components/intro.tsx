                After a degree in economics (which I had no interest in btw), I
                started working in corporate finance, where I soon found myself
                occupied with the mundane tasks associated with the job. Got
                sick of em reeeal quick, prompting me to explore ways of
                automating these tasks. That's when I stumbled upon this magical
                thing called{" "}
                <span className="text-amber-950 dark:text-white">
                  "Programming"
                </span>
                .
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                My first program was a script I found on Stack Overflow, which I
                somehow modified to streamline Windows tasks, such as attaching
                receipts to a thousand emails and sending them to the right
                recipients with just a click of a button. Imagine doing all of
                that manually... can you blame me?
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                Honestly, till today I don't know what that script was. But hey,
                everything can lead to a good outcome if you want it to, right?
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                There were two paths I could have takenâ€” one leading me to
                cultivating my interest in{" "}
                <span className="text-amber-900 dark:text-white">
                  "making life easier"
                </span>{" "}
                a.k.a{" "}
                <span className="text-amber-900 dark:text-white">
                  software development
                </span>{" "}
                (obviously the good), and the other involving hating my job,
                whining about it, sucking it up (as people would often advise),
                and eventually quitting, leading to a cycle of dissatisfaction
                about life. You see where I'm going with this?
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
                The point is, if I hadn't tried to find a way out of the rut I
                was in, I would not have discovered something good. Quitting and
                hating is not the answer. The answer is being patient while we
                find a way. Anyway.. life's a roller coaster. Enjoy it.
